  Hi, I'm Max! I'm a photographer and filmmaker based in Indiana.



  I enjoy shooting projects that allow me to express unique elements of style, color, and aesthetics. I specifically enjoy working within the genres of horror and surrealism.​​



  If you're looking for a unique approach, or want to create something that goes against the norm, I'm your person :)

## Statement

As a filmmaker, I want to talk about subjects that may be considered more taboo, such as queer and trans identities. While my identity as a trans person will inevitably inform my perspective as a filmmaker, I wish to include aspects of transness in a normalized way, that doesn’t place the entire onus of a story onto the fact that trans identity is being discussed. My works discuss gender identity, but it’s much larger than that. I explore what it means to experience one of the most basic human emotions; fear. How do we respond to it? How do we overcome it (if we even can at all)?

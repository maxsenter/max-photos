  confront his religious fears of immorality, or succumb to the grim fate of
  eternal damnation .
synopsis: >-
  Nineteen-year-old Oliver lives alone on a rural farm, surrounded by scripture,
  silence, and a faith that feels more like surveillance than comfort. After
  receiving a cross necklace from his local priest, Oliver begins experiencing
  terrifying nocturnal visitations—blinding light, thunderous wings, and a
  presence that watches from the shadows. Each encounter leaves him more
  convinced that he is being punished by God for something he cannot control.


  Seeking answers, Oliver turns to the church for guidance, only to find his fears reinforced. The priest insists that suffering is a test of faith, that temptation must be restrained, and that obedience is salvation. As the supernatural manifestations intensify, Oliver begins to realize the truth: the entity haunting him is not drawn to his “sin,” but to the power that feeds on it.


  In a final confrontation that blurs the line between divine intervention and abuse, Oliver must choose whether to submit to the faith that condemns him—or reclaim it on his own terms.


  BE NOT AFRAID is a psychological horror film about religious trauma, identity, and the violence of moral certainty, asking what happens when fear is preached as love.
